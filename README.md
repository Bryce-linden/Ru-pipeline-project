### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario

User Case Scenario #1:
Upon arriving at the interactive, the European Parliament Member's assistant (user) is greeted with a sight level overview of proportional symbols representing natural gas coming in through the border where the major pipelines originating in Russia intersect these points. The proportional symbols are sized relative to the volume of natural gas being imported into the respective country. The user is prompted to select a proportional symbol on the map to retrieve natural gas import data regarding the amount of oil crossing the border and can begin analysis by comparing oil volumes imported between European countries. The user selects proportional symbols to identify locations they are of interest, to examine the flow of natural gas from Russia, and rank the volume of natural gas coming from the pipelines between border crossings.  The user also has the affordance to overlay a choropleth map representing net import of natural gas for the top 10 European countries in order to compare and rank which European countries import more oil from these pipelines. The user can pan and zoom into areas represented on the map to show natural gas trade associated with Russia and the European countries. The assistant then uses the information from the interface to advise the member of the EU parliament about the amount of natural gas being imported and the association of Russia to European countries regarding the natural gas trade and where the EU could look to different sources to secure energy needs.  

User Case Scenario #2
Upon arriving at the interactive, the European Parliament Member's assistant (user) is greeted with a sight level overview. The user wishes to re-express the visual data from a map to a temporal line chart representing the monthly import data for the years 2019-2022 year-to-date for each European country selected. The user can also temporally sequence by month and year to see changes in natural gas imports being visually represented by proportional symbols. The user wants to examine trends in natural gas imports for each country per year and per month. The user can compare the monthly natural gas imports and rank the highest months of import to examine the data for anomalies. The user can advise the European Parliament Member on when to look for alternative energy sources during higher use months, as the conflict in Russia has made the fuel supply chain unpredictable.
