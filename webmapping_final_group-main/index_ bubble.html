        <h6>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is displayed in the chart rather than nominal GDP because it provides insight into a countryâ€™s wealth 
            in relation to its population. Therefore, it is a better measure of overall prosperity by indicating how a country's wealth is distributed. 
            A country may have a relatively high GDP in relation to other countries, but if its population is disproportionately higher than its GDP, it would 
            not be considered prosperous. By this measure, small countries with a high GDP like Luxembourg are shown to be prosperous while larger countries 
            with low a GDP are shown to be poor. Interestingly, Ukraine had the second-largest economy in the former USSR; however, after the fall of the USSR 
            difficulty transitioning to a market economy, government corruption, and Russian aggression sent the country into poverty. Based on available data, 
            Ukraine was considered the poorest country in Europe by 2020.</h6>

        <h6>Although the primary focus of this examination is imports and exports between Russia and the largest European countries, all other nations with 
            available import and export data were included here to provide a better overall comparison of the regional natural gas trade. Throughout the period 
            examined, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Turkey are consistently the principal importers of natural gas while Russia, 
            Norway, Ukraine, Belarus, Tunisia, and the Netherlands are the principal exporters. Increases in the natural gas imports and exports of these countries 
            increases significantly during winter months as expected. Other countries not listed above have comparatively smaller sized imports and exports without 
            major shifts during the winter and summer months.</h6>
    
        <h6>Additionally, the data shows a fundamental shift in Russia's natural gas exports in May of 2019. Prior to that month, Russia had the highest export 
            values with Norway just below Russia. After May 2019, Russia's exports to Europe decrease dramatically and Norway becomes the leading exporter with 
            small export increases for the Netherlands, Belarus, and Ukraine. It is unclear if these shifts are due to possible inconsistencies in the data or 
            sociopolitical catalysts.</h6>
